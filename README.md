# Focal.
Eliminate social distractions on a task to task basis.

---- 
## What’s Focal?
Focal is a tool that can help you get focused on your day to day tasks.

> The goal is to be able to block websites on a scheduled basis, to eliminate social distractions that keep me and many other people from getting work done.

Focal should be an app like [SelfControl] but with much more flexibility and versatility. Focal is my attempt to getting rid of the constant urge to check social networks, but still allow the occasional check (but only at certain times). Focal is my approach to teaching myself discipline with scheduled and therefor mindful usage of social networks.

## Scratching my own itch.
This project is a personal endeavour on tackling the constant distractions caused by Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. I can’t stand the fact that my focus is prone to those distractions but it’s a fact I can’t deny. And since I’m a maker, I had to do something about it.

> I wanted to create a tool that lets me cancel out all distractions on a planned basis.

There are solutions out there like [SelfControl], but to me, the software is lacking functionality and comfort. I want to be able to manage blacklists based on tasks or environments. having multiple blocking lists for every kind of situation. One for University, one for Work, one for casual surfing. All with different sites on them and different restriction levels.

Also I want to be able to schedule locks. I want to be able to create a weekly schedule, when wich list should be enabled and disabled. I want to be able to plan my day and the software should do the work for me without having to do anything. Scheduled blocking basically.
